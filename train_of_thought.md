## When to Think of Using a JOIN

You should think of using a JOIN when:

1. Data resides in multiple related tables:
    - For example, you need to combine information about employees (Emp) and departments (Dept).
2. A common key links the tables:
    - In this case, eid (employee ID) and managerid form the relationship.
3. You need information from both tables to solve the problem:
    - You need ename from Emp and budget from Dept.

## How to Recognize Problems for GROUP BY and HAVING?

Ask these questions:

Do you need to consider all rows for each unique value in a column?

Yes → Likely a GROUP BY problem.
E.g., "Check all departments managed by a manager."
Do you need to perform an aggregation (e.g., MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT) for these groups?

Yes → GROUP BY required.
E.g., "Find the minimum budget for departments managed by each manager."
Do you need to filter based on aggregated values?

Yes → Use HAVING.
E.g., "Only include managers where MIN(budget) > $1.5 million."

## Why This Approach Is Intuitive
Think in groups: You naturally think of managers as groups of departments.
Aggregate to simplify: Aggregations like MIN, MAX, or SUM let you condense data to a single value for each group.
Filter on the result: HAVING lets you enforce conditions on the aggregated values
